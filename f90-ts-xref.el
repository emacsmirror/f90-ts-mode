;;; Commentary:

;; Provide a basic xref implementation for `f90-ts-mode'.  The implementation
;; does not filter semantically and finds many references not in scope at
;; point.  It is not intended to replace a proper xref tool like eglot/lsp.
;; It immediately defers to these tools if those are used.

;; Provide a basic xref backend for `f90-ts-mode'.  It works on the
;; current buffer only.  Definitions, references and apropos are found by
;; tree-sitter queries over the buffer syntax tree, hence nothing in other
;; files or modules is found.  Matching is by name (case-insensitive) without
;; any consideration of scope.  References may include unrelated symbols.
;;
;; This is not meant to replace a proper xref tool.  The backend is not
;; selected if eglot, lsp-mode or a tags table is used.
