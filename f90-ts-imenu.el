;;; Commentary:

;; Provide imenu for `f90-ts-mode'.  It captures groups listed in
;; `f90-ts--nav-queries' from `f90-ts-auxiliary'.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'treesit)

;; defface and defcustom stuff
(require 'f90-ts-custom)

;; provide workarounds and missing functions
(require 'f90-ts-workaround)

;; auxiliary stuff
(require 'f90-ts-auxiliary)
